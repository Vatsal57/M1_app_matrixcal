## Introduction
We use mathematical procedures on a daily basis. We are confronted with a variety of calculations, many of which can be reduced using matrices. A matrix is a mathematical construct made up of rows and columns of numbers. In actual life, matrices are used in a variety of applications. Even most complex ML algorithms have basic operations on matrices as their root.
## Research

This research concentrates on square matrices and matrix operations. Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the operations done on a pair of square matrices. Transpose, determinant, and inverse are the operations performed on a single square matrix.
## Cost and Features and Timeline
The cost of implementing a matrix computations project is little if any. However, research and development has allowed to extend matrix applications to state-of-the-art areas such as machine learning, image processing, cryptography,Â and so on. This application is also useful for doing matrices-related calculations.

This program has dynamic memory allocation involved for allocating memory for the matrices, i.e 2 dimensional arrays. A structure is implemented for storing the input matrices. The user can select the opeation to be performed by pressing a number on the keyboard. The significance of each number, i.e the operation which it performs will be displayed on the screen during the execution of the program.
## Defining Our System
The system on the whole is viewed as a blackbox which accepts input of a single number. Then the mapping of the number is done so as to perform the appropriate function. Then the user will be prompted to enter the matrix size. After that the user is prompted to enter the matrix elements. The input is stored in 2D arrays which are dynamically allocated and passed to the respective functions. Then the output is printed on the screen. This whole process is in a loop until the user presses a key which will exit the program.
